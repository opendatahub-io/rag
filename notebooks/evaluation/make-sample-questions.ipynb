    "This notebook starts with a reference to a directory full of documents and an abstract description of the content of those documents.  It then does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It uses the abstract description of the documents to generate a bunch of questions by calling a question generator model, which is currently set to gpt-4o.  You want a very powerful and smart model for that purpose because generating a large volume of questions from an abstract description is a pretty challenging task.\n",
    "2. It builds a vector database from the content of those documents using Docling to analyze them.\n",
    "3. It uses RAG and a reference answer generator model (also gpt-4o currently) to generate reference answers.  You really need a very powerful model to be the reference answer generator because you're going to be treating these reference answers as ground truth for the smaller and presumably less powerful models that you were trying to actually evaluate in the next notebook.\n",
    "4. It through each of the reference answers and asks the reference answer generator model to assess whether the answer is really answering the question or just saying that it doesn't know.  This is important because often you want a separate analysis for how well each model works on those questions that have reference answers versus how well each model works on those questions where the reference behavior is do not answer because the content doesn't say.\n",
    "5. It stores all of this information in a file for use in the next notebook, [evaluate-using-sample-questions.ipynb](./evaluate-using-sample-questions.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have time, you should also get a human to vet the reference answers and improve them, but that's expensive to do at scale so I think in practice often that's not going to happen."

Power  consists  of  highperformance servers, designed and engineered for data intensive and AI-enabled workloads and optimized for hybrid cloud and Linux. The Storage portfolio consists of a broad range of storage hardware and software-defined offerings, including Z-attach and distributed flash, tape solutions, software-defined storage controllers, data protection software and network-attach storage. IBM Cloud IaaS is built on enterprise-grade hardware with leading security and compliance capabilities and offers flexible computing options across architectures to meet client workload needs.\\n\\nInfrastructure  Support:  delivers  comprehensive, proactive  and  AI-enabled  maintenance  and  support  services  to  maintain  and improve the availability and value of clients' IT infrastructure (hardware and software) both on-premises and in the cloud including maintenance for IBM products and other technology products.\",\n",

The  company  also  offers installation services for its more complex hardware products. Hardware offerings are often sold with distinct maintenance services, described in the Services section above.\\n\\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control has transferred to the customer which typically occurs when the hardware has been shipped to the client, risk of loss has transferred to the client and the company has a present right to payment for the hardware. In limited circumstances when a hardware sale includes client acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized either when client  acceptance has been obtained, client acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the company has objective evidence that the criteria specified in the client acceptance provisions have been satisfied. Revenue from hardware sales-type leases is recognized at the beginning of the lease term. Revenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the rental or lease.\\n\\nRevenue  from  as-a-Service  arrangements  is  recognized  either  on  a  straight-line  basis  or  on  a  usage  basis  as  described  in  the Services section above. Installation services are accounted for as distinct performance obligations with revenue recognized as the services are performed. Shipping and handling activities that occur after the client has obtained control of a product are accounted for  as  an  activity  to  fulfill  the  promise  to  transfer  the  product  rather  than  as  an  additional  promised  service  and,  therefore,  no revenue is deferred and recognized over the shipping period.\"]"

We just discard the retrieve context instead of creating them as reference contexts because there's no particular reason to believe that they're particularly good.  If we had an ultra-high power search capability (e.g., something that retrieved a long list of results and then had a powerful model rate each result), we would want to use it here to get reference contexts and then use those reference context to generate the answer instead of the actual retrieve contexts.\n",

That RAG is very slow because it calls the LLM on each search result separately to assess the search result quality before then taking the search results rated highest by the LLM and using them to generate the answer (and recording them as the reference contexts).  It would be impractical to do this in a deployed application, but it can be useful for evaluation purposes because we expect it to generate something that is closer to a \"ground truth\" for evaluation then what we would get with a simpler/faster RAG."

       "  'reference': \"Based on IBM's 2024 Annual Report, the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives appear to support its ability to sustain or potentially increase dividend payouts to shareholders. Here are some key points from the report that influence this assessment:\\n\\n1. **Revenue Growth and Cash Flow**: IBM reported $62.8 billion in revenue, with a 3% increase at constant currency, and generated $12.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $1.5 billion year-over-year. Strong revenue growth and cash flow generation provide a solid foundation for sustaining dividend payouts.\\n\\n2. **Investment in Growth Areas**: IBM has made significant investments in AI and hybrid cloud, which are expected to drive future growth. The company allocated over $7 billion to research and development and completed 11 acquisitions to enhance its capabilities.

       "   \"## Financial Performance Summary\\n\\nIn 2024, we reported $62.8 billion in revenue, income from continuing operations of $6.0 billion, which includes the impact of the pension  settlement  charges  of  $3.1  billion  ($2.4  billion  net  of  tax),  and  operating  (non-GAAP)  earnings  of  $9.7  billion,  which excludes the impact of the pension settlement charges. Refer to 'Organization of Information,' for additional information. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $6.42 as reported, including an impact of $2.57 from the pension settlement charges, and diluted earnings per share was $10.33 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We generated $13.4 billion in cash from operations  and  $12.7  billion  in  free  cash  flow,  and  returned  $6.1  billion  to  shareholders  in  dividends.  We  are  pleased  with  the progress we made in 2024, delivering revenue growth in our re-positioned business and strong cash flow generation. Our 2024 performance demonstrates the success of our focused strategy, enhanced portfolio and sustainable revenue growth. We increased our  investment  in  innovation  and  talent  and  completed  eleven  acquisitions  in  2024,  strengthening  our  hybrid  cloud  and  AI capabilities, all while continuing to return value to shareholders through our dividend.\\n\\nTotal revenue grew 1.4 percent year to year as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year, led by our Software performance. Software revenue increased 8.3 percent as reported and 9.0 percent adjusted for currency, with strength across our portfolio. Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions increased 8.1 percent as reported and 8.7 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting growth across all lines of business with double-digit revenue growth in Red Hat and Automation. Transaction Processing increased 8.7 percent as reported and 9.6 percent adjusted for currency, with growth in both recurring and transactional revenue. Consulting revenue decreased 0.9 percent as reported but grew 0.6 percent adjusted for currency, and continued to be impacted by a dynamic market environment as clients reprioritized spending. Infrastructure decreased 3.9 percent year to year as reported and 2.7 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting product cycle dynamics.\\n\\nFrom  a  geographic  perspective,  Americas  revenue  decreased  1.3  percent  year  to  year  as  reported  (0.7  percent  adjusted  for currency).  Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) increased 5.1 percent as reported (4.7 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific grew 3.0 percent as reported (7.9 percent adjusted for currency).\\n\\nGross  margin  of  56.7  percent  increased  1.2  points  year  to  year,  with  continued  margin  expansion  driven  by  portfolio  mix  and ongoing productivity initiatives. Operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 57.8 percent increased 1.3 points versus the prior year, due to the same dynamics.\\n\\nTotal expense and other (income) increased 16.2 percent in 2024 versus the prior year primarily driven by the pension settlement charges of $3.1 billion in 2024, higher spending reflecting our continued investment in portfolio innovation to drive our strategy and higher  workforce rebalancing charges. This was partially offset by a gain from the sale of certain QRadar Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) assets, the gain on the divestiture of The Weather Company assets, the benefits from productivity and the actions taken to transform  our  operations,  and  the  effects  of  currency.  Total  operating  (non-GAAP)  expense  and  other  (income)  increased  1.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors described above, excluding the pension settlement charges.\\n\\nPre-tax income from continuing operations was $5.8 billion in 2024 compared with $8.7 billion in the prior year and pre-tax margin was  9.2  percent,  a  decrease  of  4.8  points  versus  2023.  The  year-to-year  performance  was  primarily  driven  by  the  pension settlement charges in 2024 partially offset by our gross margin expansion and the benefits from productivity and the actions taken to transform our operations which enabled investments to drive innovation. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2024 was (3.8) percent compared to 13.5 percent in 2023. The current-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by the tax impact of the pension settlement charges and the resolution of certain tax audit matters. Net income from continuing operations was $6.0 billion in 2024 compared with $7.5 billion in the prior year and net income from continuing operations margin was 9.6 percent, a decrease of 2.6 points year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $11.2 billion increased 8.7 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 1.2 points to 17.9 percent. Our revenue growth, portfolio mix and productivity initiatives resulted in strong operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income growth in 2024 compared to the prior year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2024 was 13.6 percent compared to 14.0 percent\"]},\n",

In 2024, we had double-digit revenue growth in OpenShift and Ansible, and high single-digit revenue growth in RHEL. The  growth  in  OpenShift  revenue  reflects  increased  volume  in  OpenShift  Virtualization  engagements,  and  we  exited  2024  with OpenShift annual recurring revenue of $1.4 billion. Automation revenue increased 14.2 percent as reported (14.8 percent adjusted for  currency),  driven  by  our  SaaS  subscription  offerings  such  as  AIOps  and  Management,  which  includes  the  higher  revenue contribution  from Apptio.  Data  &amp;  AI  revenue  increased  1.6  percent  as  reported  (2.2  percent  adjusted  for  currency),  with  strong growth in  Data  Fabric  and  our  AI  assistant  for  Customer  Care,  driven  by  client  demand  for  our  watsonx  platform  offerings,  and strength  in  asset  and  supply  chain  management  software  which  helps  clients  run  sustainable  operations.  Security  revenue increased 0.8 percent as reported (1.5 percent adjusted for currency), with revenue growth in data security and identity and access management, partially offset by a revenue decline in security threat management.\\n\\nAcross Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $15.3 billion exiting 2024, growing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our  Hybrid  Platform  &amp;  Solutions  business  within  the  Software  segment.  The  metric  was  updated  in  the  first  quarter  of 2024  to reflect the organizational changes described in the 'Organization of Information' section above, and to simplify the calculation. ARR is  calculated  by  using  the  current  quarter's  recurring  revenue  and  then  multiplying  that  value  by  four.  This  value  includes  the following  consumption  models:  (1)  software  subscription  agreements,  including  committed  term  licenses,  (2)  as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods.\\n\\nTransaction Processing revenue of $8,277 million increased 8.7 percent as reported (9.6 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. The performance in 2024 is the result of the combination of clients' growing capacity demands, solid renewal rates,  and  increased  contribution  from  our  generative  AI  products,  including  watsonx  code  assistant  for  Z.  This  growth reflects the innovation and value of our transaction processing software, which helps our clients manage their most mission-critical workloads.\",\n",

       "   \"## Looking Forward\\n\\nTechnology has proven to be a fundamental source of competitive advantage and is now the key to sustainable growth and business transformation. Continued demand for technology will serve as a major driving force behind global economic and business growth as businesses look to scale, offer better services, drive efficiencies and seize new market opportunities. AI-driven productivity, in particular, continues to be a top priority for businesses for both cost reductions and new revenue opportunities.\\n\\nEnterprise AI continues to gain momentum. Our clients have moved beyond experimentation and are now looking to scale AI in their businesses and generate return from their investments. The portfolio of AI offerings we have built is focused on generating that return through productivity improvements and automation. We have infused AI across the business, from the tools clients use to manage  and  optimize  their  hybrid  cloud  environments,  to  the  tools  to  deploy  AI  within  their  enterprise,  to  Infrastructure  and Consulting, there is AI innovation within all of our segments. For example, in Software, IBM watsonx provides a robust portfolio of AI products  for  developing  AI  apps,  managing  data,  and  governing  the  entire  lifecycle  of  AI  models.  Red  Hat  is  bringing  AI  to  the platform with innovation such as OpenShift AI and RHEL AI. In Transaction Processing, we are experiencing continued customer interest  in  our  generative  AI  product,  watsonx  Code  Assistant  for  Z.  In  Infrastructure,  IBM  Z  is  equipped  with  real  time  AI inferencing capabilities. We continue to see Infrastructure play a larger role, enabling hybrid cloud environments for mission-critical transactions and AI workloads, as clients bring AI to their data. In Consulting, our experts are helping clients design and execute AI strategies by leveraging the IBM Consulting Advantage platform, an AI delivery platform designed to implement solutions at scale, transforming how our consultants work and harnessing AI across every stage of the project lifecycle.\\n\\nWe are committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI, to help our clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills, and IBM with Red Hat can be a key driver of open-source AI. In the second quarter of 2024, we open-sourced IBM's Granite models, which are designed for specific purposes and significantly more cost-efficient than larger alternatives, and we see parallels to how Linux became a leader in the enterprise server space as a result of the speed and innovation offered by open source. Red Hat and IBM also launched InstructLab to evolve and improve AI models. Our partner ecosystem remains essential to both AI and hybrid cloud growth and we continue to progress strategic partnerships with leading technology providers. In August 2024, we completed the sale  of  certain  IBM  QRadar  SaaS  assets  to  Palo  Alto,  which  is  part  of  a  partnership  with  them  to  deliver  AI-powered  security solutions using watsonx to clients.\\n\\nWe continue to invest in emerging technologies, bringing new innovations to market. In 2024, we expanded our IBM Quantum Data Center in Poughkeepsie, New York and opened the first IBM Quantum Data Center in Europe. We also announced a partnership with the State of Illinois to build the National Quantum Algorithm Center in Chicago and deploy a next-generation IBM Quantum System Two, supporting the future of quantum-centric supercomputing and greatly advancing our goal of expanding access to the world's most  performant  quantum  computers.  We  also  remained  focused  on  portfolio  optimization.  In  January  2024,  we  closed  the divestiture of The Weather Company assets. To complement our portfolio, we completed eleven acquisitions in 2024, including the acquisition of the StreamSets and webMethods assets from Software AG. This acquisition brings together leading capabilities in integration, API management, and data ingestion. At the end of 2024, we closed the acquisition of Neural Magic, which strengthens our AI capabilities in performance engineering and model optimization.\\n\\nOn April 24, 2024, we announced our intent to acquire all of the outstanding shares of HashiCorp. The combination of IBM's and HashiCorp's  combined  portfolios  will  help  clients  manage  growing  application  and  infrastructure  complexity  and  create  a comprehensive end-to-end hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, HashiCorp shareholders on record immediately prior to the effective time on the closing date will receive $35 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. On July 15, 2024, HashiCorp stockholders voted to approve the merger with IBM. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, HashiCorp will be integrated into the Software segment.\\n\\nIn 2024, we continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and drive productivity across our business. We have made significant progress in becoming a higher growth, more focused business that has delivered sustained revenue growth, strong cash generation and meaningful returns to all our stakeholders - our 2024 performance is a proof point of this  progress.  Today,  IBM  is  a  software-led,  fully  integrated  platform  company,  a  business  well positioned for 2025 and the future.\\n\\nIn  the  first  quarter  of  2025,  we  announced  changes  to  the  reported  revenue  categories  within  our  Software  and  Consulting reportable segments to better reflect the market opportunities and how we address them. IBM will report revenue and year-to-year revenue percent change for Hybrid Cloud (Red Hat), Automation, Data, and Transaction Processing within Software, and for Strategy and Technology and Intelligent Operations within Consulting. These changes were effective January 1, 2025 and will not impact our Consolidated  Financial  Statements  or  our  reportable  segments.  Since  these  changes  did  not  occur  until  first-quarter  2025,  the periods presented in this Annual Report reflect the historical reported revenue categories.\"]},\n",

       "   \"## Financial Performance Summary\\n\\nIn 2024, we reported $62.8 billion in revenue, income from continuing operations of $6.0 billion, which includes the impact of the pension  settlement  charges  of  $3.1  billion  ($2.4  billion  net  of  tax),  and  operating  (non-GAAP)  earnings  of  $9.7  billion,  which excludes the impact of the pension settlement charges. Refer to 'Organization of Information,' for additional information. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $6.42 as reported, including an impact of $2.57 from the pension settlement charges, and diluted earnings per share was $10.33 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We generated $13.4 billion in cash from operations  and  $12.7  billion  in  free  cash  flow,  and  returned  $6.1  billion  to  shareholders  in  dividends.  We  are  pleased  with  the progress we made in 2024, delivering revenue growth in our re-positioned business and strong cash flow generation. Our 2024 performance demonstrates the success of our focused strategy, enhanced portfolio and sustainable revenue growth. We increased our  investment  in  innovation  and  talent  and  completed  eleven  acquisitions  in  2024,  strengthening  our  hybrid  cloud  and  AI capabilities, all while continuing to return value to shareholders through our dividend.\\n\\nTotal revenue grew 1.4 percent year to year as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year, led by our Software performance. Software revenue increased 8.3 percent as reported and 9.0 percent adjusted for currency, with strength across our portfolio. Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions increased 8.1 percent as reported and 8.7 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting growth across all lines of business with double-digit revenue growth in Red Hat and Automation. Transaction Processing increased 8.7 percent as reported and 9.6 percent adjusted for currency, with growth in both recurring and transactional revenue. Consulting revenue decreased 0.9 percent as reported but grew 0.6 percent adjusted for currency, and continued to be impacted by a dynamic market environment as clients reprioritized spending. Infrastructure decreased 3.9 percent year to year as reported and 2.7 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting product cycle dynamics.\\n\\nFrom  a  geographic  perspective,  Americas  revenue  decreased  1.3  percent  year  to  year  as  reported  (0.7  percent  adjusted  for currency).  Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) increased 5.1 percent as reported (4.7 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific grew 3.0 percent as reported (7.9 percent adjusted for currency).\\n\\nGross  margin  of  56.7  percent  increased  1.2  points  year  to  year,  with  continued  margin  expansion  driven  by  portfolio  mix  and ongoing productivity initiatives. Operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 57.8 percent increased 1.3 points versus the prior year, due to the same dynamics.\\n\\nTotal expense and other (income) increased 16.2 percent in 2024 versus the prior year primarily driven by the pension settlement charges of $3.1 billion in 2024, higher spending reflecting our continued investment in portfolio innovation to drive our strategy and higher  workforce rebalancing charges. This was partially offset by a gain from the sale of certain QRadar Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) assets, the gain on the divestiture of The Weather Company assets, the benefits from productivity and the actions taken to transform  our  operations,  and  the  effects  of  currency.  Total  operating  (non-GAAP)  expense  and  other  (income)  increased  1.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors described above, excluding the pension settlement charges.\\n\\nPre-tax income from continuing operations was $5.8 billion in 2024 compared with $8.7 billion in the prior year and pre-tax margin was  9.2  percent,  a  decrease  of  4.8  points  versus  2023.  The  year-to-year  performance  was  primarily  driven  by  the  pension settlement charges in 2024 partially offset by our gross margin expansion and the benefits from productivity and the actions taken to transform our operations which enabled investments to drive innovation. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2024 was (3.8) percent compared to 13.5 percent in 2023. The current-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by the tax impact of the pension settlement charges and the resolution of certain tax audit matters.

Our strategic focus is hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI), today's most transformative technologies. As clients drive business growth using their existing technology and investing in new ones, they seek flexibility across distributed technology environments and the need to realize value from AI. We have shaped our business to focus on those client needs.\",\n",
       "   \"## Management Discussion\\n\\nInternational Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\\n\\nSoftware revenue of $27,085 million increased 8.3 percent as reported (9.0 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year, reflecting growth across all lines of business with double-digit growth in Red Hat and Automation and high single-digit growth  in  Transaction  Processing.  This  revenue  performance  reflects  the  investments  we  have  been  making  in  Software,  both organically and through acquisitions. Our investments in generative AI are contributing to growth, as we had strong demand for our generative AI products such as watsonx, Concert and our AI assistants. We also launched new products in the fourth quarter of 2024  including  our  next  generation  of  watsonx  Code  Assistant  and  Guardium  Quantum  Safe.  In  2024,  we  also  had  increased revenue contribution from acquisitions compared to the prior year, including Apptio and StreamSets and webMethods. In addition, we  had  solid  growth  in  our  recurring  revenue  and  double-digit  growth  in  our  transactional  software  revenue  in  2024,  as  we accelerated growth through innovation across our Software portfolio.\\n\\nHybrid Platform &amp; Solutions revenue of $18,808 million increased 8.1 percent as reported (8.7 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year.

In 2024, we had double-digit revenue growth in OpenShift and Ansible, and high single-digit revenue growth in RHEL. The  growth  in  OpenShift  revenue  reflects  increased  volume  in  OpenShift  Virtualization  engagements,  and  we  exited  2024  with OpenShift annual recurring revenue of $1.4 billion. Automation revenue increased 14.2 percent as reported (14.8 percent adjusted for  currency),  driven  by  our  SaaS  subscription  offerings  such  as  AIOps  and  Management,  which  includes  the  higher  revenue contribution  from Apptio.  Data  &amp;  AI  revenue  increased  1.6  percent  as  reported  (2.2  percent  adjusted  for  currency),  with  strong growth in  Data  Fabric  and  our  AI  assistant  for  Customer  Care,  driven  by  client  demand  for  our  watsonx  platform  offerings,  and strength  in  asset  and  supply  chain  management  software  which  helps  clients  run  sustainable  operations.  Security  revenue increased 0.8 percent as reported (1.5 percent adjusted for currency), with revenue growth in data security and identity and access management, partially offset by a revenue decline in security threat management.\\n\\nAcross Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $15.3 billion exiting 2024, growing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our  Hybrid  Platform  &amp;  Solutions  business  within  the  Software  segment.  The  metric  was  updated  in  the  first  quarter  of 2024  to reflect the organizational changes described in the 'Organization of Information' section above, and to simplify the calculation. ARR is  calculated  by  using  the  current  quarter's  recurring  revenue  and  then  multiplying  that  value  by  four.  This  value  includes  the following  consumption  models:  (1)  software  subscription  agreements,  including  committed  term  licenses,  (2)  as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods.\\n\\nTransaction Processing revenue of $8,277 million increased 8.7 percent as reported (9.6 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. The performance in 2024 is the result of the combination of clients' growing capacity demands, solid renewal rates,  and  increased  contribution  from  our  generative  AI  products,  including  watsonx  code  assistant  for  Z.  This  growth reflects the innovation and value of our transaction processing software, which helps our clients manage their most mission-critical workloads.\",\n",

       "   \"## Looking Forward\\n\\nTechnology has proven to be a fundamental source of competitive advantage and is now the key to sustainable growth and business transformation. Continued demand for technology will serve as a major driving force behind global economic and business growth as businesses look to scale, offer better services, drive efficiencies and seize new market opportunities. AI-driven productivity, in particular, continues to be a top priority for businesses for both cost reductions and new revenue opportunities.\\n\\nEnterprise AI continues to gain momentum. Our clients have moved beyond experimentation and are now looking to scale AI in their businesses and generate return from their investments. The portfolio of AI offerings we have built is focused on generating that return through productivity improvements and automation. We have infused AI across the business, from the tools clients use to manage  and  optimize  their  hybrid  cloud  environments,  to  the  tools  to  deploy  AI  within  their  enterprise,  to  Infrastructure  and Consulting, there is AI innovation within all of our segments. For example, in Software, IBM watsonx provides a robust portfolio of AI products  for  developing  AI  apps,  managing  data,  and  governing  the  entire  lifecycle  of  AI  models.  Red  Hat  is  bringing  AI  to  the platform with innovation such as OpenShift AI and RHEL AI. In Transaction Processing, we are experiencing continued customer interest  in  our  generative  AI  product,  watsonx  Code  Assistant  for  Z.  In  Infrastructure,  IBM  Z  is  equipped  with  real  time  AI inferencing capabilities. We continue to see Infrastructure play a larger role, enabling hybrid cloud environments for mission-critical transactions and AI workloads, as clients bring AI to their data. In Consulting, our experts are helping clients design and execute AI strategies by leveraging the IBM Consulting Advantage platform, an AI delivery platform designed to implement solutions at scale, transforming how our consultants work and harnessing AI across every stage of the project lifecycle.\\n\\nWe are committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI, to help our clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills, and IBM with Red Hat can be a key driver of open-source AI. In the second quarter of 2024, we open-sourced IBM's Granite models, which are designed for specific purposes and significantly more cost-efficient than larger alternatives, and we see parallels to how Linux became a leader in the enterprise server space as a result of the speed and innovation offered by open source. Red Hat and IBM also launched InstructLab to evolve and improve AI models. Our partner ecosystem remains essential to both AI and hybrid cloud growth and we continue to progress strategic partnerships with leading technology providers. In August 2024, we completed the sale  of  certain  IBM  QRadar  SaaS  assets  to  Palo  Alto,  which  is  part  of  a  partnership  with  them  to  deliver  AI-powered  security solutions using watsonx to clients.\\n\\nWe continue to invest in emerging technologies, bringing new innovations to market. In 2024, we expanded our IBM Quantum Data Center in Poughkeepsie, New York and opened the first IBM Quantum Data Center in Europe. We also announced a partnership with the State of Illinois to build the National Quantum Algorithm Center in Chicago and deploy a next-generation IBM Quantum System Two, supporting the future of quantum-centric supercomputing and greatly advancing our goal of expanding access to the world's most  performant  quantum  computers.  We  also  remained  focused  on  portfolio  optimization.  In  January  2024,  we  closed  the divestiture of The Weather Company assets. To complement our portfolio, we completed eleven acquisitions in 2024, including the acquisition of the StreamSets and webMethods assets from Software AG. This acquisition brings together leading capabilities in integration, API management, and data ingestion. At the end of 2024, we closed the acquisition of Neural Magic, which strengthens our AI capabilities in performance engineering and model optimization.\\n\\nOn April 24, 2024, we announced our intent to acquire all of the outstanding shares of HashiCorp. The combination of IBM's and HashiCorp's  combined  portfolios  will  help  clients  manage  growing  application  and  infrastructure  complexity  and  create  a comprehensive end-to-end hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, HashiCorp shareholders on record immediately prior to the effective time on the closing date will receive $35 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. On July 15, 2024, HashiCorp stockholders voted to approve the merger with IBM. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, HashiCorp will be integrated into the Software segment.\\n\\nIn 2024, we continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and drive productivity across our business. We have made significant progress in becoming a higher growth, more focused business that has delivered sustained revenue growth, strong cash generation and meaningful returns to all our stakeholders - our 2024 performance is a proof point of this  progress.  Today,  IBM  is  a  software-led,  fully  integrated  platform  company,  a  business  well positioned for 2025 and the future.\\n\\nIn  the  first  quarter  of  2025,  we  announced  changes  to  the  reported  revenue  categories  within  our  Software  and  Consulting reportable segments to better reflect the market opportunities and how we address them. IBM will report revenue and year-to-year revenue percent change for Hybrid Cloud (Red Hat), Automation, Data, and Transaction Processing within Software, and for Strategy and Technology and Intelligent Operations within Consulting. These changes were effective January 1, 2025 and will not impact our Consolidated  Financial  Statements  or  our  reportable  segments.  Since  these  changes  did  not  occur  until  first-quarter  2025,  the periods presented in this Annual Report reflect the historical reported revenue categories.\"]},\n",

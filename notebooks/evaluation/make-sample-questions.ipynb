    "This notebook starts with a reference to a directory full of documents and an abstract description of the content of those documents.  It then does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It uses the abstract description of the documents to generate a bunch of questions by calling a question generator model, which is currently set to gpt-4o.  You want a very powerful and smart model for that purpose because generating a large volume of questions from an abstract description is a pretty challenging task.\n",
    "2. It builds a vector database from the content of those documents using Docling to analyze them.\n",
    "3. It uses RAG and a reference answer generator model (also gpt-4o currently) to generate reference answers.  You really need a very powerful model to be the reference answer generator because you're going to be treating these reference answers as ground truth for the smaller and presumably less powerful models that you were trying to actually evaluate in the next notebook.\n",
    "4. It iterates through each of the reference answers and asks the reference answer generator model to assess whether the answer is really answering the question or just saying that it doesn't know.  This is important because often you want a separate analysis for how well each model works on those questions that have reference answers versus how well each model works on those questions where the reference behavior is do not answer because the content doesn't say.\n",
    "5. It stores all of this information in a file for use in the next notebook, [evaluate-using-sample-questions.ipynb](./evaluate-using-sample-questions.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have time, you should also get a human to vet the reference answers and improve them, but that's expensive to do at scale."

    "## Question type prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "These prompts are adapted from Docling SDG's [generation_prompts.py](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-sdg/blob/main/docling_sdg/qa/prompts/generation_prompts.py). However, they've been rewritten to use abstract descriptions of content rather than the content itself. This approach serves two main objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Generating More Realistic and Challenging Questions*\n",
    "\n",
    "First, generating questions from abstract descriptions yields queries that are less directly tied to the specific terminology, level of specificity, and phrasing of the source document's text. Solutions that generate questions directly from document passages, tend to produce questions that closely mirror the original text. This can make it easier to locate relevant documents and extract answers.  That's unhelpful for test data, because it can lead to a misleadingly high assessment of system accuracy. Questions generated this way are inherently easier for systems designed to find direct textual matches, often resulting in artificially inflated performance metrics. By using abstract descriptions, we aim to create a more challenging and realistic test set that better reflects real-world user queries, which often don't precisely echo the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Evaluating Unanswerable Questions*\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, when questions are generated from an abstract understanding of the content, it naturally leads to instances where the generated questions may not be directly answerable by the available content. Many RAG systems are designed with the crucial capability to identify and decline to answer questions for which insufficient information exists within their knowledge base. To effectively evaluate a RAG system's proficiency in this \"unanswerable question\" scenario, it's essential to have a test set that includes examples of queries a user might reasonably pose based on a general understanding of the available content, but which aren't explicitly addressed by the specific documents. This allows for a robust assessment of the system's ability to differentiate between answerable and unanswerable queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this work builds upon the significant and valuable innovation presented by the Docling SDG project. Their [research](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-industry.4/) demonstrates the clear benefit of explicitly prompting for diverse question types (e.g., single-fact, summary, reasoning), leading to a much richer and varied set of generated questions. Our goal is to retain these advantages, leveraging the insights into effective question type prompting, while simultaneously addressing the limitations of existing approaches that generate questions directly from document content instead of from a more abstract representation."

It includes IBM Z and LinuxONE, with a range of high-performance systems designed to address enterprise computing capacity, security and performance needs, z/OS, a securityrich, high-performance enterprise operating system, as well as Linux and other operating systems.\\n\\nDistributed  Infrastructure: includes  Power,  Storage  and  IBM  Cloud  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS).  Power  consists  of  highperformance servers, designed and engineered for data intensive and AI-enabled workloads and optimized for hybrid cloud and Linux. The Storage portfolio consists of a broad range of storage hardware and software-defined offerings, including Z-attach and distributed flash, tape solutions, software-defined storage controllers, data protection software and network-attach storage. IBM Cloud IaaS is built on enterprise-grade hardware with leading security and compliance capabilities and offers flexible computing options across architectures to meet client workload needs.\\n\\nInfrastructure  Support:  delivers  comprehensive, proactive  and  AI-enabled  maintenance  and  support  services  to  maintain  and improve the availability and value of clients' IT infrastructure (hardware and software) both on-premises and in the cloud including maintenance for IBM products and other technology products.\",\n",
       " \"## Hardware\\n\\nThe company's hardware offerings include the sale or lease of Hybrid Infrastructure solutions including IBM Z as well as Distributed Infrastructure solutions such as Power and Storage solutions. The capabilities of these products can also be delivered through as-aService  or  cloud  delivery  models,  such  as  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  and  Storage-as-a-Service.  The  company  also  offers installation services for its more complex hardware products. Hardware offerings are often sold with distinct maintenance services, described in the Services section above.\\n\\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control has transferred to the customer which typically occurs when the hardware has been shipped to the client, risk of loss has transferred to the client and the company has a present right to payment for the hardware. In limited circumstances when a hardware sale includes client acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized either when client  acceptance has been obtained, client acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the company has objective evidence that the criteria specified in the client acceptance provisions have been satisfied. Revenue from hardware sales-type leases is recognized at the beginning of the lease term. Revenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the rental or lease.\\n\\nRevenue  from  as-a-Service  arrangements  is  recognized  either  on  a  straight-line  basis  or  on  a  usage  basis  as  described  in  the Services section above. Installation services are accounted for as distinct performance obligations with revenue recognized as the services are performed. Shipping and handling activities that occur after the client has obtained control of a product are accounted for  as  an  activity  to  fulfill  the  promise  to  transfer  the  product  rather  than  as  an  additional  promised  service  and,  therefore,  no revenue is deferred and recognized over the shipping period.\"]"

We will label these \"reference answers\" because they're being generated by the model that we have designated to be our reference answer generator, i.e., the model that we trust to be close enough to perfect that it can act as our \"ground truth\" for evaluating the other models that we intend to evaluate.  We just discard the retrieve context instead of creating them as reference contexts because there's no particular reason to believe that they're particularly good.  If we had an ultra-high power search capability (e.g., something that retrieved a long list of results and then had a powerful model rate each result), we would want to use it here to get reference contexts and then use those reference context to generate the answer instead of the actual retrieve contexts.\n",

That RAG is very slow because it uses LlamaIndex's LLMReranker to assess search result quality before then taking the search results rated highest by the LLM and using them to generate the answer (and recording them as the reference contexts).  It is often impractical to do this in a deployed application because it is slow, but it can be useful for evaluation purposes because we expect it to generate something that is closer to a \"ground truth\" for evaluation then what we would get with a simpler/faster RAG."

This decline was consistent with the z16 cycle, which was introduced in the second quarter of 2022. Despite the decrease, the z16 program significantly outperformed prior cycles, including the successful z15 program. The z16 mainframe incorporates key innovations such as cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum-safe cyber-resilient security, energy efficiency, and strong reliability and scalability. Clients increasingly leveraged IBM Z for more workloads, driving demand for more capacity, and installed MIPS have doubled during the last two IBM Z product cycles. IBM Z remains an enduring platform, driving hardware adoption as well as related software, storage, and services.\\n\\nIn 2024, IBM z16 was highlighted as the most successful mainframe program in IBM's history, underscoring its enduring value to clients.

       "   \"## Management Discussion\\n\\nInternational Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\\n\\nSoftware revenue of $27,085 million increased 8.3 percent as reported (9.0 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year, reflecting growth across all lines of business with double-digit growth in Red Hat and Automation and high single-digit growth  in  Transaction  Processing.  This  revenue  performance  reflects  the  investments  we  have  been  making  in  Software,  both organically and through acquisitions. Our investments in generative AI are contributing to growth, as we had strong demand for our generative AI products such as watsonx, Concert and our AI assistants. We also launched new products in the fourth quarter of 2024  including  our  next  generation  of  watsonx  Code  Assistant  and  Guardium  Quantum  Safe.  In  2024,  we  also  had  increased revenue contribution from acquisitions compared to the prior year, including Apptio and StreamSets and webMethods. In addition, we  had  solid  growth  in  our  recurring  revenue  and  double-digit  growth  in  our  transactional  software  revenue  in  2024,  as  we accelerated growth through innovation across our Software portfolio.\\n\\nHybrid Platform &amp; Solutions revenue of $18,808 million increased 8.1 percent as reported (8.7 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. Within Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, Red Hat revenue increased 11.4 percent as reported (12.0 percent  adjusted  for  currency),  which  reflects  the  continued  demand  for  our  hybrid  cloud  solutions  as  clients  are  prioritizing application modernization on OpenShift containers and Ansible automation to optimize their IT spending and reduce operational complexity. In 2024, we had double-digit revenue growth in OpenShift and Ansible, and high single-digit revenue growth in RHEL. The  growth  in  OpenShift  revenue  reflects  increased  volume  in  OpenShift  Virtualization  engagements,  and  we  exited  2024  with OpenShift annual recurring revenue of $1.4 billion. Automation revenue increased 14.2 percent as reported (14.8 percent adjusted for  currency),  driven  by  our  SaaS  subscription  offerings  such  as  AIOps  and  Management,  which  includes  the  higher  revenue contribution  from Apptio.  Data  &amp;  AI  revenue  increased  1.6  percent  as  reported  (2.2  percent  adjusted  for  currency),  with  strong growth in  Data  Fabric  and  our  AI  assistant  for  Customer  Care,  driven  by  client  demand  for  our  watsonx  platform  offerings,  and strength  in  asset  and  supply  chain  management  software  which  helps  clients  run  sustainable  operations.  Security  revenue increased 0.8 percent as reported (1.5 percent adjusted for currency), with revenue growth in data security and identity and access management, partially offset by a revenue decline in security threat management.\\n\\nAcross Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $15.3 billion exiting 2024, growing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our  Hybrid  Platform  &amp;  Solutions  business  within  the  Software  segment.  The  metric  was  updated  in  the  first  quarter  of 2024  to reflect the organizational changes described in the 'Organization of Information' section above, and to simplify the calculation. ARR is  calculated  by  using  the  current  quarter's  recurring  revenue  and  then  multiplying  that  value  by  four.  This  value  includes  the following  consumption  models:  (1)  software  subscription  agreements,  including  committed  term  licenses,  (2)  as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods.\\n\\nTransaction Processing revenue of $8,277 million increased 8.7 percent as reported (9.6 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. The performance in 2024 is the result of the combination of clients' growing capacity demands, solid renewal rates,  and  increased  contribution  from  our  generative  AI  products,  including  watsonx  code  assistant  for  Z.  This  growth reflects the innovation and value of our transaction processing software, which helps our clients manage their most mission-critical workloads.\",\n",

Refer to 'Organization of Information,' for additional information. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $6.42 as reported, including an impact of $2.57 from the pension settlement charges, and diluted earnings per share was $10.33 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We generated $13.4 billion in cash from operations  and  $12.7  billion  in  free  cash  flow,  and  returned  $6.1  billion  to  shareholders  in  dividends.  We  are  pleased  with  the progress we made in 2024, delivering revenue growth in our re-positioned business and strong cash flow generation. Our 2024 performance demonstrates the success of our focused strategy, enhanced portfolio and sustainable revenue growth. We increased our  investment  in  innovation  and  talent  and  completed  eleven  acquisitions  in  2024,  strengthening  our  hybrid  cloud  and  AI capabilities, all while continuing to return value to shareholders through our dividend.\\n\\nTotal revenue grew 1.4 percent year to year as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year, led by our Software performance. Software revenue increased 8.3 percent as reported and 9.0 percent adjusted for currency, with strength across our portfolio. Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions increased 8.1 percent as reported and 8.7 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting growth across all lines of business with double-digit revenue growth in Red Hat and Automation. Transaction Processing increased 8.7 percent as reported and 9.6 percent adjusted for currency, with growth in both recurring and transactional revenue. Consulting revenue decreased 0.9 percent as reported but grew 0.6 percent adjusted for currency, and continued to be impacted by a dynamic market environment as clients reprioritized spending. Infrastructure decreased 3.9 percent year to year as reported and 2.7 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting product cycle dynamics.\\n\\nFrom  a  geographic  perspective,  Americas  revenue  decreased  1.3  percent  year  to  year  as  reported  (0.7  percent  adjusted  for currency).  Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) increased 5.1 percent as reported (4.7 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific grew 3.0 percent as reported (7.9 percent adjusted for currency).\\n\\nGross  margin  of  56.7  percent  increased  1.2  points  year  to  year,  with  continued  margin  expansion  driven  by  portfolio  mix  and ongoing productivity initiatives. Operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 57.8 percent increased 1.3 points versus the prior year, due to the same dynamics.\\n\\nTotal expense and other (income) increased 16.2 percent in 2024 versus the prior year primarily driven by the pension settlement charges of $3.1 billion in 2024, higher spending reflecting our continued investment in portfolio innovation to drive our strategy and higher  workforce rebalancing charges. This was partially offset by a gain from the sale of certain QRadar Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) assets, the gain on the divestiture of The Weather Company assets, the benefits from productivity and the actions taken to transform  our  operations,  and  the  effects  of  currency.  Total  operating  (non-GAAP)  expense  and  other  (income)  increased  1.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors described above, excluding the pension settlement charges.\\n\\nPre-tax income from continuing operations was $5.8 billion in 2024 compared with $8.7 billion in the prior year and pre-tax margin was  9.2  percent,  a  decrease  of  4.8  points  versus  2023.  The  year-to-year  performance  was  primarily  driven  by  the  pension settlement charges in 2024 partially offset by our gross margin expansion and the benefits from productivity and the actions taken to transform our operations which enabled investments to drive innovation. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2024 was (3.8) percent compared to 13.5 percent in 2023. The current-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by the tax impact of the pension settlement charges and the resolution of certain tax audit matters. Net income from continuing operations was $6.0 billion in 2024 compared with $7.5 billion in the prior year and net income from continuing operations margin was 9.6 percent, a decrease of 2.6 points year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $11.2 billion increased 8.7 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 1.2 points to 17.9 percent. Our revenue growth, portfolio mix and productivity initiatives resulted in strong operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income growth in 2024 compared to the prior year.

This  revenue  performance  reflects  the  investments  we  have  been  making  in  Software,  both organically and through acquisitions. Our investments in generative AI are contributing to growth, as we had strong demand for our generative AI products such as watsonx, Concert and our AI assistants. We also launched new products in the fourth quarter of 2024  including  our  next  generation  of  watsonx  Code  Assistant  and  Guardium  Quantum  Safe.  In  2024,  we  also  had  increased revenue contribution from acquisitions compared to the prior year, including Apptio and StreamSets and webMethods. In addition, we  had  solid  growth  in  our  recurring  revenue  and  double-digit  growth  in  our  transactional  software  revenue  in  2024,  as  we accelerated growth through innovation across our Software portfolio.\\n\\nHybrid Platform &amp; Solutions revenue of $18,808 million increased 8.1 percent as reported (8.7 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. Within Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, Red Hat revenue increased 11.4 percent as reported (12.0 percent  adjusted  for  currency),  which  reflects  the  continued  demand  for  our  hybrid  cloud  solutions  as  clients  are  prioritizing application modernization on OpenShift containers and Ansible automation to optimize their IT spending and reduce operational complexity. In 2024, we had double-digit revenue growth in OpenShift and Ansible, and high single-digit revenue growth in RHEL. The  growth  in  OpenShift  revenue  reflects  increased  volume  in  OpenShift  Virtualization  engagements,  and  we  exited  2024  with OpenShift annual recurring revenue of $1.4 billion. Automation revenue increased 14.2 percent as reported (14.8 percent adjusted for  currency),  driven  by  our  SaaS  subscription  offerings  such  as  AIOps  and  Management,  which  includes  the  higher  revenue contribution  from Apptio.  Data  &amp;  AI  revenue  increased  1.6  percent  as  reported  (2.2  percent  adjusted  for  currency),  with  strong growth in  Data  Fabric  and  our  AI  assistant  for  Customer  Care,  driven  by  client  demand  for  our  watsonx  platform  offerings,  and strength  in  asset  and  supply  chain  management  software  which  helps  clients  run  sustainable  operations.  Security  revenue increased 0.8 percent as reported (1.5 percent adjusted for currency), with revenue growth in data security and identity and access management, partially offset by a revenue decline in security threat management.\\n\\nAcross Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $15.3 billion exiting 2024, growing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our  Hybrid  Platform  &amp;  Solutions  business  within  the  Software  segment.  The  metric  was  updated  in  the  first  quarter  of 2024  to reflect the organizational changes described in the 'Organization of Information' section above, and to simplify the calculation. ARR is  calculated  by  using  the  current  quarter's  recurring  revenue  and  then  multiplying  that  value  by  four.  This  value  includes  the following  consumption  models:  (1)  software  subscription  agreements,  including  committed  term  licenses,  (2)  as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods.\\n\\nTransaction Processing revenue of $8,277 million increased 8.7 percent as reported (9.6 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. The performance in 2024 is the result of the combination of clients' growing capacity demands, solid renewal rates,  and  increased  contribution  from  our  generative  AI  products,  including  watsonx  code  assistant  for  Z.

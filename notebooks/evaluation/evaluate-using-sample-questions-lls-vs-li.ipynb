      "World War I, also known as the Great War, began in 1914 and was the result of a complex interplay of factors that had been building up over several decades. Here are some of the key reasons why WWI started:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**: The immediate catalyst for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary and his wife, Sophie, on June 28, 1914, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist. This event set off a chain reaction of diplomatic and military mobilizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Alliance System**: Europe was divided into two main alliance systems: the Triple Entente, consisting of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and the Triple Alliance, comprising Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. These alliances were meant to provide mutual defense and maintain a balance of power, but they also meant that a conflict involving one country could quickly involve others.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Militarism**: There was a significant build-up of military forces and an arms race among the major European powers. This militarism created an environment where war was seen as an acceptable means of resolving disputes and achieving national goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nationalism**: Nationalistic fervor was on the rise, with various ethnic groups seeking independence or greater autonomy. This was particularly evident in the Balkans, where Slavic nationalism was a direct threat to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Imperial Rivalries**: The major powers were competing for colonies and global influence. This imperial competition created tensions and conflicts in various parts of the world, contributing to the overall instability in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Crisis Management Failures**: The diplomatic crisis following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was poorly managed. Austria-Hungary, with the backing of Germany, issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which led to a series of mobilizations and declarations of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **The July Crisis**: The period following the assassination, known as the July Crisis, saw a series of diplomatic failures and miscommunications. The complex web of alliances and treaties meant that once Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, other nations were quickly drawn into the conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors, among others, created a volatile situation in Europe that ultimately led to the outbreak of World War I. The war lasted until 1918 and resulted in significant political, social, and economic changes worldwide.\n"

The year-to-year increase in free cash \\nflow primarily reflects current year performance-related improvements within net income and sustainable lower cash requirements\\nthrough changes in our retirement plans. In 2024, net capital expenditures and net cash from operating activities include $0.4 \\nbillion and $0.1 billion, respectively, of cash proceeds from the sale of certain QRadar SaaS assets. This benefit to net capital \\nexpenditures, net cash from operating activities and to free cash flow represented only a nominal net benefit to current-year cash \\nflows due to payments for structural actions and foregone profit from the QRadar business. Refer to note E, “Acquisitions & \\nDivestitures,” for additional information. In 2024, we continued to return value to shareholders with $6.1 billion in dividends and \\ninvested $3.3 billion in acquisitions. \\nIBM’s Board of Directors considers the dividend payment on a quarterly basis.

IBM does not have \"ratings trigger\" provisions in its debt covenants, which would allow holders to declare an event of default in case of a change in credit rating. The major ratings agencies have assigned IBM the following ratings for its debt securities:\\n\\n- Standard and Poor\\'s: A-\\n- Moody\\'s Investors Service: A3\\n- Fitch Ratings: A-\\n\\nThese ratings indicate a strong credit quality for IBM. The company has financial flexibility supported by its strong liquidity position and cash flows to operate at a single A credit rating.\\n\\nIn terms of negotiating favorable terms with suppliers or partners, IBM\\'s credit ratings and debt levels are important factors. A higher credit rating signifies lower credit risk, which can lead to more favorable terms and conditions in negotiations. Additionally, a company with manageable debt levels is generally viewed more positively by suppliers and partners, as it indicates financial stability and reliability in meeting financial obligations.'},\n",

These partnerships are crucial for driving digital transformation and innovation in the industry.\\n\\nAdditionally, IBM has adopted a \"client zero\" philosophy, meaning they benefit from the same technology solutions offered to clients. They have aggressively adopted AI-powered automation to drive productivity, with examples like AI assistants answering HR queries and faster contract drafting processes. These efforts have resulted in significant productivity savings and have positioned IBM as a leader in AI adoption.\\n\\nIBM is committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI, aiming to help clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills. Partnerships with companies like Red Hat play a key role in driving open-source AI initiatives. IBM continues to invest in emerging technologies, expand its quantum computing capabilities, and optimize its portfolio through acquisitions.\\n\\nOverall, IBM\\'s AI initiatives in 2024 are expected to strengthen its partnerships with leading technology providers, drive innovation, and create new business opportunities.

Overall, IBM has delivered approximately $3.5 billion in productivity savings since the beginning of 2023.\\n\\nIBM\\'s strategy aligns with the needs of its clients, as organizations increasingly deploy technology workloads across hybrid cloud architectures and seek to realize value from AI. By embracing a hybrid \\'by design\\' platform approach, IBM Consulting has quantified the value of this strategy, showing over three times higher return on investment.\\n\\nFurthermore, IBM collaborates with strategic partners like AWS, Microsoft, Salesforce, and others to amplify joint impact for clients by embedding IBM technology into core platforms. This collaborative approach helps IBM meet clients where they are and bring next-generation innovations to a wide range of clients and partners.\\n\\nIn conclusion, IBM\\'s remote work strategy, combined with its focus on hybrid cloud and AI technologies, positions the company to create new sources of competitive advantage, drive innovation, and deliver value to clients in the tech industry.'}]"

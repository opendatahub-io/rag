The Simpsons – Overview
The Simpsons is a long-running animated television sitcom created by Matt Groening. First airing in 1989, the show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and satirizes American culture, society, and television. The series centers around the Simpson family — Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie — and their interactions with a diverse range of supporting characters. Known for its humor, cultural references, and social commentary, The Simpsons has become a cornerstone of modern pop culture and is one of the most influential TV shows in history.

Homer Simpson
Homer Jay Simpson is the bumbling but lovable father of the Simpson family. He works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as a safety inspector, despite being lazy and incompetent. Homer is known for his love of donuts, beer (especially Duff Beer), and television. He's overweight, bald, and often acts impulsively, but he deeply loves his family in his own misguided way.

Marge Simpson
Marjorie "Marge" Simpson is the caring and patient matriarch of the family. She has a tall blue beehive hairstyle and is known for her moral integrity and common sense. Marge is a homemaker who often acts as the voice of reason in the chaotic Simpson household. She is deeply devoted to her husband and children, even when they drive her crazy.

Bart Simpson
Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson is the 10-year-old son of Homer and Marge. A rebellious troublemaker, Bart is known for his mischievous pranks, slingshot, and catchphrases like “Eat my shorts!” He struggles academically but is street-smart and clever. Bart often clashes with authority figures and is a constant source of stress for his teachers and Principal Skinner.

Lisa Simpson
Lisa Marie Simpson is the 8-year-old daughter of the Simpsons. Highly intelligent and talented, Lisa excels in school and plays the saxophone. She is a vegetarian, a Buddhist, and an environmentalist with strong social values. Despite being the youngest sibling after Maggie, she is often the most mature member of the family and frequently challenges societal norms.

Maggie Simpson
Margaret "Maggie" Simpson is the baby of the family. She rarely speaks but is known for her pacifier-sucking and surprising displays of intelligence. Maggie is observant and occasionally performs impressive feats for her age, often unnoticed by the adults around her.

Grandpa Simpson
Abraham "Abe" Simpson is Homer’s elderly father. A resident of the Springfield Retirement Castle, Grandpa often tells long-winded, rambling stories about his past. He’s forgetful and sometimes grumpy, but he genuinely cares for his family despite being a little out of touch.

Milhouse Van Houten
Milhouse is Bart’s best friend. He’s awkward, nerdy, and often the victim of school bullies. Milhouse is loyal but easily manipulated, and he has an unrequited crush on Lisa.

Mr. Burns
Charles Montgomery Burns is the wealthy, elderly owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He’s greedy, ruthless, and power-hungry, often putting profit over safety or morality. Mr. Burns is one of the main antagonists of the series, frequently showing disregard for others, especially his employees.
